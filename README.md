--- Tic Tac Toe Game ---
A simple yet engaging Tic Tac Toe game built with multiple difficulty levels for AI. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts and showcases the implementation of AI for strategic gameplay.

-- Features --
Single Player Mode: Play against AI with different difficulty levels:

Easy: Makes random moves.
Medium: Plays a mix of strategic and random moves.
Hard: Plays optimally to ensure the best possible outcome.
Two Player Mode: Play with a friend on the same device.

Interactive UI: Easy-to-use interface for seamless gameplay.
